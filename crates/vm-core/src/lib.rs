//! Core abstractions for executing [`mpz_vm_ir`] modules under a multi-party
//! virtual machine.
//!
//! The crate splits execution into a deterministic, party-agnostic
//! [`Thread`] interpreter and an embedder that drives it. A thread steps
//! through an [`mpz_vm_ir`] [`Module`], emitting a stream of [`Directive`]s
//! that describe the abstract operations to perform. Operations whose operands
//! are [`Visibility::Private`] or [`Visibility::Blind`] are expressed
//! symbolically through [`Operand`] and [`Op`]; operations on
//! [`Visibility::Public`] data are evaluated concretely in-thread.
//!
//! The [`Vm`] trait is the high-level interface an embedder exposes for
//! writing inputs, revealing outputs, reading memory, and invoking functions.
//! The `mpz-vm-ideal` crate provides a single-machine reference implementation
//! of [`Vm`] used for testing.
//!
//! # Threading model
//!
//! - [`Thread`] holds the per-party interpreter state and produces a
//!   [`StepResult`] on each [`Thread::step`], which is passed the shared
//!   [`Module`] and mutable [`Global`] state.
//! - When a thread cannot proceed without external input it returns
//!   [`StepResult::Blocked`] carrying a [`Pending`] request, which the embedder
//!   satisfies with the matching `Thread::resolve_*` method.
