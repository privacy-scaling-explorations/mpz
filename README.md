# MPZ

mpz is a collection of multi-party computation libraries written in Rust ü¶Ä.

This project strives to provide safe, performant, modular and portable MPC software with a focus on usability.

See [our design doc](./DESIGN.md) for information on design choices, standards and project structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This project is currently under active development and should not be used in production. Expect bugs and regular major breaking changes. Use at your own risk.
