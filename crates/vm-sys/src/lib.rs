//! Guest-side bindings for the VCI (verifiable-compute interface).
//!
//! A program compiled to wasm and run inside the VC VM links against this crate
//! to invoke the VM's VCI host calls, imported from the `vc` module. The VCI
//! operation is [`reveal`](Reveal::reveal): disclosing a value the program
//! holds — concrete or symbolic — so that it becomes public. It is two-phase:
//! `reveal` returns a handle immediately and the handle's `wait` blocks for the
//! result, which lets a program batch and pipeline reveals.
//!
//! Reveal is defined for the four wasm value types (`i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`)
//! and for byte slices (`&[u8]`). On non-wasm targets the bindings compile to
//! clear-execution no-ops — every value is already public — so the same program
//! runs natively.
