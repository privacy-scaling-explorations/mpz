# MPZ

mpz is a collection of multi-party computation libraries written in Rust ü¶Ä.

This project strives to provide safe, performant, modular and portable MPC software with a focus on usability.

See [our design doc](./DESIGN.md) for information on design choices, standards and project structure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This project is currently under active development and should not be used in production. Expect bugs and regular major breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

## Crates

**Core**
  - `mpz-core` - Assortment of low-level primitives.
  - `matrix-transpose` - Bit-wise matrix transposition.
  - `clmul` - Carry-less multiplication

**Circuits**
  - `mpz-circuits` - Boolean circuit DSL
  - `mpz-circuits-macros` - Proc-macros for `mpz-circuits`

**Oblivious Transfer**
  - `mpz-ot` - High-level async APIs
  - `mpz-ot-core` - Low-level types for OT, and core implementations of OT protocols.
