//! Correlated GGM tree, also known as the "half-tree".
//!
//! Implements the cGGM construction from [Half-Tree](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1431)
//! (Figure 3). Every parent node `x` has left child `H(x)` and right child
//! `x + H(x)`, where `H` is a circular correlation-robust hash function. This
//! maintains the invariant that the nodes of every level sum to the global
//! offset `delta`, which halves both the computation (1 hash per node pair)
//! and the communication (1 block per level) of a distributed point function
//! compared to a standard GGM tree.
//!
//! Nodes are field elements: the tree operates over [`Gf2_128`], whose addition
//! is the bitwise XOR the construction calls for. The only byte-wise step is
//! the hash itself, which is a raw-block AES PRG, so the field elements cross
//! to `Block` at that boundary.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Each level is expanded in place using the split layout: the left children
//! overwrite their parents in the lower half of the buffer and the right
//! children are appended to the upper half. Consequently, the leaf reached by
//! taking the `b_i` child at level `i` is stored at index `Σ b_i ⋅ 2^(i-1)`,
//! i.e. an index encodes its path with the level-1 bit in the least
//! significant position.
