//! Polynomial-constraint expressions for the composite QuickSilver check
//! (eprint 2021/076, §5).
//!
//! A constraint is a polynomial `f` over committed wire values with
//! `f(w) = 0`. Instead of committing every intermediate product (circuit
//! mode), a degree-`d` constraint is evaluated *symbolically* into a
//! polynomial in `Δ`:
//!
//! - The prover holds, per wire, the linear form `mac + value·X`; building `f`
//!   over these forms yields the coefficient vector of `g(X) = Σ_h f_h(mac +
//!   value·X)·X^{d-h}` ([`ProverCoeffs<V>`]). The top coefficient (`X^d`) is
//!   `f(w)`, dropped by the protocol.
//! - The verifier holds, per wire, the key `k = mac + value·Δ`; building `f`
//!   over the keys yields `g(Δ)` directly ([`VerifierCoeffs`]).
//!
//! Both build the *same* expression with the `+`/`-`/`*` operators; at `Δ` the
//! prover's coefficient vector and the verifier's value agree. Addition
//! top-aligns operands (multiplying the lower-degree one by `X^shift` /
//! `Δ^shift`) so each (sub)expression stays top-aligned to its own degree,
//! matching the `X^{d-h}` weighting. All arithmetic is over characteristic-2
//! fields, so negation is the identity and subtraction equals addition.
//!
//! # Compile-time degree
//!
//! An expression's degree is part of its *type*: [`Expr<C, N>`] carries a
//! [`typenum`] degree `N`, and the operators raise it at the type level —
//! `Add` takes the max ([`Maximum`]), `Mul` the sum ([`Sum`]). This sizes the
//! prover's coefficient storage to the *actual* degree of each expression
//! (a degree-2 product stores two coefficients, not [`MAX_DEGREE`]), and lets
//! the compiler unroll the convolution and alignment loops. Gadgets stay
//! generic over the carrier `C` (so one definition runs on both prover and
//! verifier); the concrete degrees flow through inference without any
//! per-gadget bounds.
//!
//! The carrier `C` is what differs between the two sides ([`ProverCoeffs<V>`]
//! keeps a coefficient vector, [`VerifierCoeffs`] keeps the single value
//! `g(Δ)`); [`PlainCoeffs<V>`] collapses an expression to its cleartext value
//! for the prover's witness pass.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! The carriers are generic over the subfield `V` (the wire-value field): the
//! boolean path uses `V = Gf2`, the [`gf64`](crate::gf64) path `V = Gf2_64`,
//! and both embed into the `GF(2^128)` MAC field as
//! [`ExtensionField<V>`](ExtensionField). The expression algebra preserves a
//! stronger invariant: the *top* coefficient of every expression lies in the
//! subfield `V`. A lifted wire is `mac + value·X` (top = `value`), a constant
//! is a bare subfield element, top-aligned addition sums tops in `V`, and
//! multiplication multiplies them. [`ProverCoeffs<V>`] therefore stores the top
//! coefficient as a `V` `value` — which doubles as the cleartext evaluation
//! `f(w)` — and only the `N` lower coefficients as MAC-field elements. The
//! cross-terms between tops and lower coefficients are subfield scalings
//! ([`ExtensionField::scale_by_subfield`]) rather than full MAC
//! multiplications, so a degree `a × b` product costs `a·b` MAC multiplications
//! rather than `(a+1)·(b+1)`. For `V = Gf2` the scaling is a branchless masked
//! XOR (no carry-less multiply at all); for `V = Gf2_64` it is a full MAC
//! multiply — a property of each subfield's `scale_by_subfield` impl.
//!
//! # Accumulation
//!
//! The challenge streams during the accumulate pass, so a constraint is folded
//! into the running check state the moment it is asserted — expressions are
//! never buffered. The prover folds its χ-weighted coefficients top-aligned to
//! [`MAX_DEGREE`] into [`ProverPoly`]; the verifier buckets `χ·g(Δ)` by
//! constraint degree in [`VerifierPoly`], deferring the `Δ^{d_max-d}`
//! alignment factor to a single multiplication per bucket. Both are additive,
//! so disjoint sub-ranges of a trace fold independently and
//! [`merge`](ProverPoly::merge).
